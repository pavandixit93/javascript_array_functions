# javascript_array_functions
This repository contains functions(prototyp ) available in javascript array.
each function is added in seperate file with one-two example.

Download index.html and *.js file and run it in your broswer and see console log for output.

I have added all js files as functionname.js in index.html and have commented them. just uncomment the line to run required function.
